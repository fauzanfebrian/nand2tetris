# Unknown Common Logic Gates

In default, Nand2Tetris HardwareSimulator is scanning through our `.hdl` implementation. In my case, I'm writting a Xor `.hdl` file, I'm sure the code is 100% correct, because I just follow the course's code, and then I test it, it's throwing an error.

## Problem Solved

I think what's wrong? the Xor implementation is correct, the instructor's code running well in his demo, and then I thought, maybe it scan my other `.hdl` implementation, so i just renaming all the related `.hdl` files, and then I try the test one more time, and it succeed.

## Verdict

Keep grinding, keep learning.
