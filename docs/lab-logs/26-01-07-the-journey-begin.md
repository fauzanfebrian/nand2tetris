# The Journey Begins

On 07 Jan 2026, at 22:56 I just finished the two first videos of the Nand2Tetris journey, and it already answered my question why **NAND**? Why **NAND** can make a computer, I thought it doesn't make any sense that a Boolean function alone can build a functional computer, until I watch the video. 

Noam Nisan taught me about Boolean Logic, Boolean Expression Boolean Function, and i just found out that **NAND** is actually a Boolean Function, that's a definition from `NOT (X AND Y)` that's why NAND is called that way, it's combination between Boolean Expression NOT and AND. One quote of his statement makes me thinking:

> Any Boolean function can be represented using an expression containing only NAND operations

I got little bit skeptical at first until he bring the proof of concept:

```
NOT(x) = (x NAND x)

(x AND y) = NOT(x NAND y)
```

Looking at this concept and thinking about it, makes me realized, this course is genius. the two first videos already dragged me into excitement of following this Nand2Tetris learning journey, and I made a commitment that I'll complete this learning journey, even tho I don't know where this journey will led me, but i believe a strong mental model will makes me a better Engineer, and I'll be a Great Engineer.
